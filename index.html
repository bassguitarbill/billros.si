        <h2>Hi</h2>
        <p>My name is Bill Rossi. I'm a millennial computer programmer and musician, with a penchant for bad jokes and a deep, abiding love of Japanese cuisine. I bought this domain name on a whim, and I plan to use it to boast and brag about my accomplishments. This is the Internet: don't let anyone lie to you and tell you that the Internet is important for commerce, or for business, or for trading pictures of monkeys back and forth in exchange for unimaginable sums of money. The Internet is looking at pictures and videos of cute animals, and talking about yourself.</p>
        <p>In my life, there is a large contradiction. One the one hand, I like talking about what I'm up to, sharing with friends and strangers alike the skills I'm learning and the stuff I'm making. On the other, I had to quit Twitter because I got very, very addicted. I therefore have nowhere to share what I've been up to. Hence, billros.si.</p>

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>In my normal life, I'm a computer programmer. I think my actual job title is "engineer" but I have some complicated thoughts about the difference between "computer science", "web development", "software engineering", and other such terms that are often used interchangably but which definitely mean different things. Anyway, I enjoy my job and I spend a good portion of my life working at it, but it doesn't have a lot to wo with who I am as a person.</p>
        <p>Unless I'm actively handing you a résumé, you probably don't need to know about my job. If you want to know about the things I program, I'd rather you know about the games I create. Programming can be used for a lot more than moving numbers across spreadsheets; it can be used for self-expression, for creative output, and for fun. I've played probably 1000 video games in my life, and only recently have I begun to make my own.</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>Here's a brag: I can play many different musical instruments. I'm gonna list them: bass guitar, guitar, drum kit, mandolin, banjo, cello, double bass, clarinet, saxophone, keyboard, and I can also sing. I've put a lot of time into the bass guitar, and it's the only instrument I'd say I'm actually good at. Everything else, I range from "mediocre" to "how the hell do I play the banjo, let me look up a video, oh there's no way that's possible". It turns out, though, that even playing an instrument badly can still be a lot of fun.</p>
        <p>I'm fortunate to have several musical friends, and it's a common occurrence for us to sit around and play mostly acoustic covers of emo songs. This is apparently a weird thing to do: we were one time pegged by an acquaintance as "church kids??", which I guess makes sense as a guess, but in reality we all just like creating music together.</p>

        <h2>Language and Phonics</h2>
        <p>There are some YouTube videos that have changed my life and two of them are important here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NvDvESEXcgE">Movie Accent Expert Breaks Down 32 Actors' Accents</a>, featuring dialect coach Eric Singer, is one. It seems very, very obvious, but the idea that different accents can be created by pronouncing vowels differently, and that vowels can be pronounced differently by moving the tongue in different ways, was completely new to me. This video focuses exclusively on English, but it led me to further explore phonics in other languages, and discover that a lot of things that I take for granted in English, like our weird "R" sound that contrasts with trills, taps, or central European uvular "R"s. For something that nearly everybody does all the time, I feel like most people don't think about the actual mechanics of speaking very much, and I find it fascinating.</p>

        <h2>Japan</h2>
        <p>The other important video is Bill Wurtz' <a href="https://youtu.be/Mh5LY4Mz15o">History of Japan</a>. Growing up, I was never especially into anime, and I've still never read a manga. Pokémon and Dragon Ball Z were just cartoons to me, and I found it impossible to understand why my friend owned a Japanese import copy of Pokémon Silver version: what was so interesting about Japan? Then the legendary Bill Wurtz released a nine-minute video about the history of an island nation that I hadn't given much thought, and it really intrigued me. How the samurai class came to power, how the country was closed to outsiders for two centuries, how it was torn open again by the United States of America, and how it rapidly modernized and began building an empire from scratch. I decided soon afterwards that I needed to see this place for myself.</p>
        <p>One thing stood (in my mind) in the way: when I get to Tokyo, how am I going to communicate? This is not Scandanavia, or even FRance, where at least in urban areas, English proficiency can be relied upon. In Japan, they speak Japanese. They learn English like we learn Spanish: everybody learns it, then most people just forget it. America being such a global cultural hegemon, English is obviously present to a degree in Japanese life, but most folks would not be able to have a complicated conversation in English. The attitude of expecting global citizens to cater to me and speak my language, I decided, was very old-fashioned, and I resolved to try my best to learn how to speak, read, and understand Japanese.</p>
        <p>It's really challenging! It's so different from English in its syntax, and its kanji logography is simply massive. Pronunciation cannot be inferred at all from the appearance of the characters, and the overwhelming majority of characters have multiple, completely different, pronunciations. After some false starts, I grabbed a popular flashcard deck and began practicing. Progress is slow, but it's coming.</p>
